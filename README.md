## Structure of PiQUM:
* Blog (LaBooK)
  * Crucial BDR runtimes.
  * Measurement status.

* Machine
  * List of Instruments based on DR affiliation.

* Mission
  * Frequency Response
  * Continuous Wave Sweeping
  * Single Qubit Pulsing
  * Qubits Orchestra

## Data Collection Protocol / Principle:
* Basic dimension size determined solely by measurement tuning parameter NOT including repeat#.
  * The "resume" of measurement only works when data size is with the basis dimension size.
  * The repeating measurement could only be performed once and should not be resumed. (Scrapped to accomodate Job queueing)

## Scripting:
* 1. Parameter Settings
  *
  
* 2. Pulse Sequencing:
